Complete Implementation Roadmap
To fully implement these changes, follow this step-by-step roadmap:

Phase 1: Context and Hook Refactoring
Update CollectionContext.js to fix the infinite loop issue
Enhance useCollection.js with URL detection and event emission
Update LayerContext.js to auto-register collections
Enhance useLayer.js with collection integration functionality
Improve useBuffer.js to handle collection audio loading
Phase 2: Component Updates
Add static methods to LayerControl.js for multiple control rendering
Simplify Player.js by removing overlapping responsibilities
Update useTimeline.js to better encapsulate timeline functionality
Phase 3: Integration and Testing
Test collection loading via URL parameters
Verify layer controls work with the updated hooks
Confirm audio loading and playback work properly
Check for any remaining render loops or performance issues
Key Architectural Benefits
This refactoring achieves several important goals:

Clear Separation of Concerns:

Collection context manages collection data only
Buffer context manages audio loading only
Layer context integrates collections with buffers
Player handles only UI and playback controls
Reduced Complexity in Player:

From 200+ lines to less than 100 lines
Removes complex state management
Eliminates manual context integration
Improved Data Flow:

Event-based communication between contexts
Automatic loading from URL parameters
Clear ownership of responsibilities
Better Performance:

Fewer render cycles
No duplicate data loading
Optimized communication between components
Enhanced Maintainability:

More modular code structure
Clearer interface boundaries
Easier to test and debug
This refactoring aligns perfectly with your desired architecture where collections maintain data, buffers deal with audio files, layers merge them together, and the Player simply controls playback and houses UI components.


Current Issues with Player.js
After thorough analysis of the Player.js file in the context of your modular architecture, I've identified several issues where the component is taking on responsibilities that should be delegated to other parts of the system:

Collection Loading & Processing

Player directly loads collections via URL parameters
Handles collection formatting (formatForPlayer)
Manages collection registration with layer system
Layer Management Overreach

Directly controls layer track changes
Manages mute toggle functionality
Handles detailed layer state (active tracks, volumes, etc.)
Manually constructs each LayerControl with granular props
Timeline Management Complexity

Uses complex local refs (preventUpdateCycle, settingsInitialized)
Handles timer synchronization logic that should be encapsulated
Manages potential race conditions with timeouts
State Duplication

Maintains local sessionDuration/transitionDuration which duplicates timeline state
Tracks previous playback state (wasPlaying.current)
Duplicates error handling from multiple contexts
Cross-Context Communication

Acts as an intermediary between contexts that should communicate directly
Manually passes data between collection, layer, and timeline contexts
Event Handling Complexity

Complex event handlers for duration changes
Manually prevents recursive updates with ref flags
